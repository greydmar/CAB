There are a few files that are not used at this time included in this zip. Some 'leftovers' from the original Presto I wrote.

To setup, you would need to change one line at the top of the 'header.asp' file.

Change 'strSiteLocation' to the correct directory off of the parent drive.


Perhaps we should change this from the onset so that it is even DEVELOPED WITH CLASP. What about that?

I know you don't like the appending and have a function in CLASP for string concatenation, so we can change the code accordingly.

Let me know what you think.
